        Why visit my site?
        The new James Webb Telescope is a topic of great interest to many people, and there are several reasons why visitors might come to this site. Firstly, there is a simple curiosity surrounding the telescope, as many people have heard of it but may not know much about it. This site aims to provide education on the James Webb Telescope and explain why it is such an incredible marvel, which may draw visitors who are curious to learn more.
        Another reason why people may come to the site is to see the incredible photographs that the James Webb Telescope has already taken. The site will showcase these images, organized by subject or theme, which may attract visitors who are interested in astronomy or simply enjoy looking at beautiful photos of space.
    </p> 
    <p>
        What questions will be answered
        Visitors to the site will expect to find answers to a number of questions about the James Webb Telescope. They will want to know what makes it special and how it differs from a normal telescope, as well as how much it cost to build and why. Additionally, they may be curious about the famous photos the telescope has taken and how the telescope relates to their own lives.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Why come to my site?
        Ultimately, visitors may choose to come to this site instead of others because it offers a comprehensive and engaging resource for learning about the James Webb Telescope. By providing valuable information, incredible photos, and interactive activities. I will also aim to make the information more accessible to a broader audience, rather than targeting only experts in the field. All of my information will be accurate, simple, and up to date. 
        In addition to the above reasons, visitors may also come to this site because of its user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation, making it easy to find the information they need.

        What “activities” will there be?
        To engage visitors, my site will offer a variety of activities. For instance, visitors could browse information and photographs, with a system that allows them to compare photos taken by the James Webb Telescope with photos taken by Hubble of the same object. Additionally, the site could offer a "tour" of the telescope, explaining the different parts and functions, or a forum for people with similar interests to discuss the telescope and related topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        What information is necessary for these actions?
        To complete these actions, visitors will require specific information, including technical specifications and capabilities of the telescope, information about the launch and deployment of the telescope, updates on new discoveries and findings made by the telescope, and information on upcoming observation plans and targets. Visitors may also be interested in learning about the scientists and engineers involved in the project and any frequently asked questions about the James Webb Telescope and astronomy in general.
